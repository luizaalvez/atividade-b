Hands in the soap <br>
Have the faucet's running <br>
And I keep looking at you <br>
Stuck on your phone <br>
And you're stuck in your zone <br>
You don't have a clue <br> <br>

But I don't wanna give up <br>
Baby, I just want you to get up <br>
Lately I've been a little fed up <br>
Wish you would just focus on <br><br>

Me <br>
Can you focus on me? <br>
Baby, can you focus on me? <br> <br>

Me <br>
Can you focus on me? <br>
Baby, can you focus on me? <br> <br>

Lazy and broke <br>
No, he get this money <br>
So I guess I can't complain <br>
But I feel alone even when we're alone <br>
And that don't cost a thing <br>

But I don't wanna give up <br>
Baby, I just want you to get up <br>
Lately I've been a little fed up <br>
Wish you would just focus on <br> <br>

Me <br>
Can you focus on me? <br>
Baby, can you focus on me? <br>
Baby <br> <br>

Me <br>
Can you focus on me? <br>
Baby, can you focus on me? <br>
Me <br> <br>

Baby, focus <br>
Can't you see? <br>
I just wanna love you, baby <br>
Look me in my eyes. <br>
